NAME
    YAML::Object

VERSION
    0.01

SYNOPSIS
        ### create object
        my $cfg = YAML::Object->LOAD('path/to/my.yaml');

        ### merge path/to/another/file.yaml with existing config-file
        $cfg->LOAD('path/to/another/file.yaml');

NOTES
    The YAML-document cannot have a key named "LOAD", since it will
    interfere with the "LOAD()" method.

METHODS
  "LOAD"
    As class-method: Object constructor. Takes one argument, which is the
    config-filename. This argument is passed on to "LOAD()";

    As object-method: Loads a file and merges it to %$self. Meaning that you
    can call "LOAD" as many times you want. The last loaded YAML-file will
    override any existing params, if there are duplicates.

  %{} or @{}
    The object is overloaded to return a hash or array.

  ""
    The object returns "HASH" or "ARRAY" in string content

  "Everything else"
    All other methods returns either:

    YAML::Object object
        ...a YAML::Object object, if the config-element points on a hash.

        This object is overloaded by %{}.

    YAML::Object::Array object
        ...a YAML::Object::Array object, if the config-element points on an
        array.

        This object is overloaded by @{}.

    scalar
        ...a scalar if that's what it points at.
